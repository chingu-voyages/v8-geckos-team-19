Before submitting a PR
----------------------

Clean up all:

Ghost Code
Console logs
Code indentations
White spaces
Empty lines at EOF
If there are passwords remove them and use environment variables
IDE setting files are not to be committed
Removing files that have been committed that you want to add to the gitignore

if you have already committed the file it won't go away if you have added the gitignore rule afterwards.
So the easiest why to fix this is to
make a local copy on your laptop
delete it in the repo
commit this change
then add it back

How to resolve comments
-----------------------

STEP 1 - If a reviewer requires changes, and you agree to those changes then change whatever is required to change on the branch that needs to be merged in.
STEP 2 - Once you've made the changes COMMIT and PUSH those changes.
Your changes will automatically be updated on your PR once you refresh the page.
STEP 3 - Reply back on that comment "Done" so that the reviewer knows and can check it for you.
STEP 4 - The reviewer will resolve the comment, you SHOULD NOT resolve the comment yourself.
STEP 5 - Once all comments are resolved you are allowed to merge your PR.
